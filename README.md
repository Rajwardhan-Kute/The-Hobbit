Hello Professor, hope you are doing well. I have added a GitHub zip file that I have a Git link for but since I couldn't add it anywhere here it is:
https://github.com/Rajwardhan-Kute/Hobi.git

To run the code here are the steps:
Downaload the files and open any editor of your choice and run the index.html file on a live server as that is the main page to start with. I will add screen shots in the submission so there is a visual uinderstanding of how the website looks before actyakky runnoing iut.
